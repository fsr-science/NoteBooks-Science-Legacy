## Overview

**NoteBooks-Science** is the Science Administration Department's official study material platform. It replaces fragmented note-sharing workflows with a centralized, professionally managed repository that ensures:

- **Quality Control** — All materials pass through administrative review
- **Accessibility** — Students and educators can easily find, download, and reference materials
- **Organization** — Structured hierarchy following the standard NCERT curriculum structure
- **Scalability** — Built to grow with the department's academic needs

### The Problem We Solve

Science students face a critical challenge: study materials are scattered across personal collections, messaging apps, and informal shares. This leads to:

- Inconsistent material quality
- Difficulty finding reliable sources
- No official reference point for curriculum-aligned content
- Repeated manual file distribution

NoteBooks-Science provides the solution.

## What is NoteBooks-Science

NoteBooks-Science is a **domain-specific knowledge platform** that functions as:

1. **A Centralized Repository** — One authoritative source for all Science curriculum materials
2. **A Document Management System** — Organized filing system with granular categorization
3. **An Anonymous Submission Interface** — Users can contribute without revealing their identity
4. **A Moderation Workflow** — Administrators review and approve all content before publication
5. **A Learning Hub** — Integrated discussion forums for doubt resolution and collaborative learning

### Backend Infrastructure

- **Upstash Redis** — Distributed session and data storage
- **Resend** — Email service for password reset notifications
- **Google reCAPTCHA v3** — Bot protection on authentication forms

### Security Features

- **JWT Tokens** — Secure session management
- **bcrypt Hashing** — Industry-standard password hashing (10-round salting)

- **Redis Storage** — Distributed session management with fallback to in-memory storage

### Data Flow

1. User submits form (with reCAPTCHA token)
2. CAPTCHA validated server-side before processing
3. Credentials hashed and stored in Redis
4. JWT issued for session management
5. Each request validated against stored session

---

## Authentication System

### Modern Email + Password System (v2.0)

**Old System** — SSH key-based authentication (deprecated and removed)

**New System** — Email + password with industry-standard security:

#### Login

- Email and password input
- reCAPTCHA v3 bot detection
- JWT token issued on success
- Session persists for 30 days

#### Registration

- Email validation
- Password requirements (minimum 8 characters)
- reCAPTCHA v3 bot detection
- Automatic account creation

#### Forgot Password

- Email-based password recovery
- reCAPTCHA protection
- 15-minute cooldown between requests (prevents abuse)
- Secure token-based reset link
- Password reset via email link

### Security Specifications

- **Password Hashing** — bcrypt with 10 salt rounds
- **Session Tokens** — JWT with 30-day expiration
- **CAPTCHA** — Google reCAPTCHA v3 (invisible, doesn't interfere with UX)
- **Rate Limiting** — 15-minute cooldown on password reset
- **Storage** — Upstash Redis with automatic fallback
- **Email Service** — Resend for secure email delivery
